# Real Time CNN Visualization

This is an UI app, which allows visualize Convolutional Neural Networks in real time.
First, Activation maps of convolutional layers as well  activations of fully connected layer are visualized and available for applying more advance visualisation techniques.

## Visualization Algorithms
