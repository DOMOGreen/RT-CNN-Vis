# Real Time CNN Visualization

This is an UI application, which allows to visualize Convolutional Neural Networks in real time.
First, Activation maps of convolutional layers as well activations of fully connected layer are visualized and available for applying more advance visualization techniques.

## Visualization Algorithms
